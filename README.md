Single LinkedList Implementation in Python:

 This is simple example of single linked list implemenatation in Python.We can create a custom Node class which can take values, so that we can create linked lists of different types using the same implementation class.
 
 We also provide various functions for our linked list such as:
  - Display the list
  - Count the data in the list
  - Search the position of the particular data in the list, it will return true or false
  - Insertion at the beginning of the list
  - Insertion at the end of the list
  - Deletion of node from between
  - Deletion of  first node
  - Deletion of only node
  - Reverse the list
  
Sorting a linked list using Bubble Sort:
- Sorting by Exchanging Data
- Sorting by Exchanging Links
